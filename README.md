# Predators-and-Prey-project
Simulation of a natural environment, where predators hunt and eat prey, and prey runs away from them. Prey have their hydration and hunger level depleted over time, so they need to drink and eat from an oasis to survive.
Each predator and prey is a thread. They are created by users and they can set certain characteristicsa, which then can be seen inf you select the object from a jlist. Predators can be removed by user by using kill a predator button. User can order a prey to seek food, water or hideout, where they can't be hunted by predators.
Predators start hunting prey either when prey is added to map or in case when there is already prey on map, then they start to hunt prey when added to map.
Each place has a maximum capacity and can only be entered if there is enough space to do that.
